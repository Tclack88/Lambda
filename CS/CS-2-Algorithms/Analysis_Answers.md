Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? (If you used any
   Python built-in functions, you can find their time complexities here:
   https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity )

2. Could you make your algorithm run in better time? If so, how?

3. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your
   implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be
   the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
