# Sprint Challenge: Algorithms

In this week's Sprint you explored and implemented some classic algorithmic approaches and used them to solve novel problems. You also implemented some classic and fundamental sorting algorithms and learned about how to go about evaluating their respective runtimes and performance. This Sprint Challenge aims to assess your comfort with these topics through exercises that build on the data structures you implemented and the algorithmic intuition you've started to build up.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your Challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered throughout this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives that were introduced and that you practiced in the preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your submitted work reflects your proficiency in the concepts and topics that were covered this week.

You have three hours to complete this Sprint Challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and it also helps your project manager to more thoroughly assess your work.

## Description

This Sprint Challenge is split into two separate parts that test your ability to write and analyze algorithms.

### Self-Study/Essay Questions

For this portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be answering questions posed in the `Algorithms_Questions.md` document inside the `Self-Study` directory. Write down your answer and also write down a justification for _why_ you put down that answer. This could net you some partial credit if your justification is sound but the answer you put down turns out to not be correct. Add your answers to the questions in the `Algorithms_Answers.md` file.

### Minimum Viable Product
#### Task 1. Implement Heapsort

Inside the `task1` directory you'll find the `heap.py` file with a working implementation of the heap class. Your second task is to implement a sorting method called [heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort) that uses the heap data structure in order to sort an array of numbers. Your `heapsort` function should return a new list containing all of the sorted data.

Run `python test_heap.py` to run the tests for your `heapsort` function to ensure that your implementation is correct.

#### Task 2. Analyze some runtimes

Open up the `Analysis_Answers.md` file. This is where you'll jot down your answers for the runtimes of the functions you just implemented. 

[4/6 questions were for data structures, maybe add to it]
