# Sprint Challenge: Graphs

There are two parts to this sprint challenge:


 * `graph_shortest_path`: For this part, you'll be extending the functionality of the breadth-first-search traversal algorithm we worked on so that it's able to find the shortest path between two input graph nodes. You'll find further instructions in the README in the directory.

 * `graph_social_network`: You have been given skeleton code for a very simple social network. You will be filling out a function that shows a user every other user in their extended friend network and the chain of friendships that link them. For testing purposes, you will also be writing a function that creates a large number of users and creates a random distribution of friendships between them.

 * The `legacy` directory contains an old exercise for archival purposes. You do not need to work on this and it will not be graded.

Good luck and have fun! :smile:
