#  Sprint Challenge: Intro to Python

## Objective
Complete the programs in the `src/` directory in any order.

* `oop/`
    * `oop1.py`: class hierarchies
    * `oop2.py`: subclassing and method overriding
* `comp/`
    * `comp.py`: list comprehensions
* `cityreader/`
    * `cityreader.py`: modules and CSV file reading

## Testing
Each file has its own associated test file. To test your code, run `python [name_of_test_file.py]` or `python3 [name_of_test_file.py]` if your Python 3 command is mapped to `python3`. 

The `cityreader` stretch goal has its own test file, `test_stretch.py`, if you want to take a stab at implementing the stretch problem.

**_It's never a bad idea to take a look at the test files in order to see what each test is expecting._**

## Rubric
The grading rubric for this Sprint Challenge is as follows:

3: All tests passing along with the stretch goal tests passing as well.

2: All tests passing for non-stretch problems.

1: Anything else.
