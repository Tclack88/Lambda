# Sprint Challenge: Graphs

There are two parts to this sprint challenge:

 * `graph_dfs_debug`: Inside this directory, you'll find an implementation of the Graphs project we worked on this last week, but it's not functioning as it should. Your job is to fix the listed issues so that the code works properly. You'll also need to document your changes in the provided `Answers.md` file. 

 * `graph_shortest_path`: For this part, you'll be extending the functionality of the breadth-first-search traversal algorithm we worked on so that it's able to find the shortest path between two input graph nodes. You'll find further instructions in the README in the directory.

Good luck and have fun! :smile:
