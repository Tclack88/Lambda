# Data Structures 

Topics:

 * Queues
 * Binary Search Trees
 * Doubly Linked Lists
 * Heaps

## Tasks
1. Implement each data structure, starting with the linked list data structure. Make sure you're in the approriate directory, then run `python3 test_[NAME OF DATA STRUCTURE].py` to run the tests for that data structure and check your progress. Get all the tests passing for each data structure.

2. Open up the `Data_Structures_Questions.md` file, which asks you to evaluate the runtime complexity of each of the methods you implemented for each data structure. Add your answers to each of the questions in the file.

### Queues
 * Should have the methods: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `len`.
   * `enqueue` should add an item to the back of the queue.
   * `dequeue` should remove and return an item from the front of the queue.
   * `len` returns the number of items in the queue.

### Binary Search Trees
* Should have the methods `insert`, `contains`, `get_max`.
  * `insert` adds the input value to the binary search tree, adhering to the rules of the ordering of elements in a binary search tree.
  * `contains` searches the binary search tree for the input value, returning a boolean indicating whether the value exists in the tree or not.
  * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the binary search tree.

### Doubly Linked Lists
 * The `ListNode` class, which represents a single node in the doubly-linked list, has already been implemented for you. Inspect this code and try to understand what it is doing to the best of your ability.
 * The `DoublyLinkedList` class itself should have the methods: `add_to_head`, `add_to_tail`, `remove_from_head`, `remove_from_tail`, `move_to_front`, `move_to_end`, `delete`, and `get_max`.
   * `add_to_head` replaces the head of the list with a new value that is passed in.
   * `add_to_tail` replaces the tail of the list with a new value that is passed in.
   * `remove_from_head` removes the head node and returns the value stored in it.
   * `remove_from_tail` removes the tail node and returns the value stored in it.
   * `move_to_front` takes a reference to a node in the list and moves it to the front of the list, shifting all other list nodes down. 
   * `move_to_end` takes a reference to a node in the list and moves it to the end of the list, shifting all other list nodes up. 
   * `delete` takes a reference to a node in the list and removes it from the list. The deleted node's `previous` and `next` pointers should point to each afterwards.
   * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the list. 
 * The `head` property is a reference to the first node and the `tail` property is a reference to the last node.

### Heaps
* Should have the methods `insert`, `delete`, `get_max`, `_bubble_up`, and `_sift_down`.
  * `insert` adds the input value into the heap; this method should ensure that the inserted value is in the correct spot in the heap
  * `delete` removes and returns the 'topmost' value from the heap; this method needs to ensure that the heap property is maintained after the topmost element has been removed. 
  * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the heap _in constant time_.
  * `_bubble_up` moves the element at the specified index "up" the heap by swapping it with its parent if the parent's value is less than the value at the specified index.
  * `_sift_down` grabs the indices of this element's children and determines which child has a larger value. If the larger child's value is larger than the parent's value, the child element is swapped with the parent.

## Stretch Goals
1. Implement a [b-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) class that adheres to the following specification:
