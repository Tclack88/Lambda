## The World Beyond Notebooks

Python Notebooks are great - they let us explore data and communicate and share
results. But if you want to write more general-purpose reusable code, you should
put it in a *package* - like numpy, pandas, and the other great tools we depend
on.

A full production-grade library is a large undertaking, but this week we will
build our own modest but still useful package with utility functions for common
data science tasks. Behold, **lambdata**!

See each module for specific objectives and assignments. Note that you will be
making the lambdata repo yourself - it will *not* be a fork, and you can have
more independence and "creative control** in where you take it. You should still
fork and open a PR to this repo, and edit this file to link to your lambdata.

--------------------

*Note* - assignments this week are all steps in a larger week-long project. They
are to be worked on in a repo you make with your own account, as instructed in
the first day. You should still fork this repo, and open a PR where you add a
`work_notes.md` file that includes a link to your project repo. You should then
update `work_notes.md` each day with the following:

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

# Unit 4 Sprint 3: Major Neural Network Architectures

This week we will review several popular feed-forward neural network architectures that are common in commercial applications. 
--- 
* Module 1: RNNs & LSTMs
  - Objectives: 
      1. Describe recurrent neural network architecture
      2. Use an LSTM to generate text based on some input
* Module 2: CNNs
  - Objectives: 
      1. Describe convolutions and convolutions within neural networks
      2. Apply pre-trained CNNs to object detection problems
* Module 3: Autoencoders
  - Objectives:
      1. Describe the componenets of an autoencoder
      2. Train an autoencoder
      3. Apply an autoencoder to a basic information retreval problem
* Module 4: Artificial General Intelligence & the Future
  - Objectives: 
      1. Describe the history of artificial intelligence research
      2. Know the important research achievements in AI
      3. Delineate the ethnical challenges faces AI
