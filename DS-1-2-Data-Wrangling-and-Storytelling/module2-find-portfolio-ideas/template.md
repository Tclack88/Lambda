# Pass 1 - Climate Change/electric & hybrid vehicles/self-driving cars, etc.
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Could do a u.s. heatmap for 'growing tendency' for a region to get an electric or hybrid vehicle

2. Trend related to the news
possibly see any correlation with number of articles or news stories related to climate change and the purchase of hybrid/electric vehicles, but that might require some NLP I don't yet understand

3. Who does that?
similar to geographic variation

4. Answering a question people care about
(See misconception below -- show evidence to prove or disprove)

5. Valuable to businesses
not sure

6. What's the most popular?
popular EV brands over time

7. Cost/Money rankings
cost of vehicle as a fraction of income or the trending make/model over time

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
"Electric vehicles are still being powered by burning coal or natural gas, so it's notvery clean" - point sources aren't as efficient as "pooled" sources, so the loss in charging a vehicle isn't as much as those in individual gasoline engines. This is at least what I've read, it would be interesting to see the data myself and arrive at my own conclusions.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
http://worrydream.com/#!/ClimateChange

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
It's very broad, I c

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
It's very broad, so I could compare end-of-life carbon emmissions or 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I think not, because the topics are very precise

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
first google result:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=ev



# Pass 2 - Rock Climbing - a meta analysis of climbers world based on user posts at mountainproject.com
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Do certain states climb stronger (due to availability of local climbing) or do gyms more or less even things out

2. Trend related to the news
n/a

3. Who does that?
What fraction of people climb above a certain difficulty grade

4. Answering a question people care about
- What is the average grade that people climb/ What percentage of people climb at a certain grade
- How many years on average does it take to get to X grade

5. Valuable to businesses
n/a

6. What's the most popular?
I could find show the most popular climbing locations and climbs by area/state

7. Cost/Money rankings
n/a

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
I don't think this exists.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I could focus on just myself and graph my "growth" over time. It may be difficult to get broad user data

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Not really, again, this is very specific

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

# Assignment!

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


Both topics are challenging. I definitely already have access to EV data, the mountainproject data is harder to comeby, at least not manually. All users have an exportable csv file, but I don't see a way to browse users. The EV topic is probably more professionally applicable but I would find personal growth and interest.
