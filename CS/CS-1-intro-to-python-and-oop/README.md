#  Sprint Challenge: Intro to Python

In this week's Sprint you explored the Python programming language as well as object-oriented design principles. This Sprint Challenge aims to assess your comfort in both of these areas through exercises similar to the ones you worked on at the beginning of this week in Intro to Python.

## Instructions
**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in the preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your submitted work reflects your proficiency in the concepts and topics that were covered this week.

You have three hours to complete this Sprint Challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and it also helps your project manager to more thoroughly assess your work.

## Description
Complete the programs in the `src/` directory in any order.

* `oop/`
    * `oop1.py`: class hierarchies
    * `oop2.py`: subclassing and method overriding
* `comp/`
    * `comp.py`: list comprehensions
* `cityreader/`
    * `cityreader.py`: modules and CSV file reading

## Testing
Each file has its own associated test file. To test your code, run `python [name_of_test_file.py]` or `python3 [name_of_test_file.py]` if your Python 3 command is mapped to `python3`. 

The `cityreader` stretch goal has its own test file, `test_stretch.py`, if you want to take a stab at implementing the stretch problem.

**_It's never a bad idea to take a look at the test files in order to see what each test is expecting._**

## Rubric
The grading rubric for this Sprint Challenge is as follows:

3: All tests passing along with the stretch goal tests passing as well.

2: All tests passing for non-stretch problems except for the `cityreader` exercise. While you may not have necessarily gotten the `cityreader` tests to pass, it should be clear to your PM that you put in a strong effort to completing this problem in your submission.

1: Any tests in other sections failing and/or little to no effort shown for the `cityreader` exercise.
